;; This is a set of convenience functions for generating esxml for
;; certain HTML elements.
;;
;; NOTICE: Code base will be trasnitioning to using pcase instead of
;; destructuring bind wherever possible.  If this leads to hard to
;; debug code, please let me know, and I will do whatever I can to
;; resolve these issues.
